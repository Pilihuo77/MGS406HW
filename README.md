This Application is for the customer to order food at Yingâ€™s Restaurant. 

The welcome page has the Title: Welcome to Ying's Restaurant. 

There is also two links 1. reserve a new table and 2. View Customer information. When the Customer clicks the reserve a new table link, a reservation page pops up and allows the customer to enter their information.

The information include Name, Email, Phone, Party Size, Reservation Date, and Reservation Time. 

I use MySQL to store these data.When Restaurant Owner click view customer information link,he/she can view all the customer who reserve the table .
